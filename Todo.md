## Control, Attack, Defense

Ideas:


### Click to move

	* Interacts well with mouse-to-face
	* Good way to travel
	* Multiple ways to control seems a bit inelegant

### Attacking and defending

Need abilities to make it interesting:

	* Shield bearers: always protected from one direction
	* Set parry: protect from a particular direction; costs 1 balance to move
	* Charge: move and attack in same turn; costs 3 balance

Balance costs for tactical engagements

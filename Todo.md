#Bugs


	* Why does the font change on first load?
	* Message order is not always sensible
	* Wonky character spacing 
		** Text looks weird, dungeon looks OK. Don't know how to force non-square ratio; 
			would also need to edit font. Low priority.
	

### New abilities

	* Set to parry: protect from a particular direction; 
		** costs 1 balance to move
		** does 1 balance damage to parried enemy
	* Set evade: leap backwards when enemy attacks
	    ** Leap takes 2 balance; 5 balance if into wall
	* Shieldbearer attacks lower shields for 1 turn 
		** maybe also have tower shield bearers without this restriction
